                To keep it simple, we'll teach you one variation of poker that is commonly played.
                    <br/>
                    
                The variant that we'll be showing you is called "Texas Hold 'Em."

                        Royal Flush: Five cards of the same suit. Ranked consecutively from Ace to Ten.
                            
                        <br/>
                        Straight Flush

                            
                            
                        To begin, deal each player two cards face down. These are called the "hole cards". Over five rounds, more cards will be dealt face up in the middle of the table. 
                            
                        <br/>
                        <br/>    

                        There are three stages that constitute the five community cards that will be dealt:
                        <br/>
                        <br/>    

                        <b>Stage 1:</b> The first three, called <b>the "flop".</b>
                            
                        <br/>
                        
                        
                        <b>Stage 2:</b>  One card is dealt, called <b>the "turn".</b>
                            
                         
                        <br/>    
                            
                        
                        <b>Stage 3:</b>  Finally one more card is dealt, called <b>the "river".</b>

                        In total, each player will now have seven cards. Each player has the choice to create their hand by using five cards of their choice out of the total seven cards.
                        
                        If two more more players do not fold, the only way to win is to have the highest ranking hand. (Rankings listed below).
                            
                        If all players fold with the exception of one player, the one player wins without showing their hand.

                            The concept of "The Button."

                            There is a dealer button that is passed around clockwise around the table. The left of the dealer button is where the game begins.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
                            The dealer button indicates where the small and big blinds occur.
                            
                            The last player closest to the button receives last action on all postflop play.

                            <br/>
                           Before every hand, two players at the table must post small and big blinds in order for the game to begin.
                            
                            Blinds are forced bets.
                            
                            <b>Positionally:
                            </b>
                            <br/>

                            The player that is to the left of the button posts the small blind, and the player to their direct left posts the big blind. 
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                            
                            <b> Preflop</b>
                            
                            After the two "hole cards" have been dealt:
                            <br/>
                            
                           As mentioned before, the player directly left of the big blind has three options:
                            
                            
                            <b>Raise:</b>
                          Increase the bet to any amount, so long as it is within the game's restrictions.

                            <b>Call:</b>
                            Raise the bet to the same amount as the big blind.
                            
                            
                            <b>Fold:</b>
                            Give up the hand.
                            
                            <br/>

                            If a player folds, they automatically give up the chance to win the hand.
